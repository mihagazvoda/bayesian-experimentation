# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Bayesian Experimentation*. This book is a work in progress.

This book explains experimentation (A/B testing) through the lens of Bayesian statistics. It aims to be a single, concise reference for the most important ideas in regards to this topic. We believe this is needed because:

* Due to lack of curriculum on the topic, there are still lots of "beginner" mistakes and fallacies going on.
* Currently, relevant information is scattered across papers and blog posts.
* Many resources focus on irrelevant aspects, such as showing equivalence with frequentist methods.

We hope this book ends fruitless online debates: share the link and move on. Life is too short to argue on social media.
